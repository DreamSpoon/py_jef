# py_jef
Additional Python 'Run Script' buttons for Blender, in many places.
Helps with addon creation by saving code that was run, it's output (print() statements, stdout), and any exceptions that occurred.

TODO:
- buttons in every possible Tools location (shader editor, graph editor, etc.)
- run code from within Text object
- save output of code to text objects, and these Text objects are parented to the object they created... or the other way around
